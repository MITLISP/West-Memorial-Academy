  <h2><span>Letter</span> from the Founder</h2>

<p style="padding-top:40px">Dear You,</p>
<p>I opened WMA to help out our parents and our school district’s special needs child last year. I am not trying to take students away from established programs, public or private. By opening this school I am answering the question, “Where do I find a school that will allow my child to attend school under this (or that) condition? Is there a school that will accept my child?”</p>

<p>I have been asked that so many times by parents with children recently diagnosed with a particular learning disability. By opening WMA I am answering the question. I have the facility that can cater to so may issues. If I do not or cannot provide the environment the child requires for a certain amount of time, I have resources in the area that have the environment the child needs</p>

<p>West Memorial Academy is a school for Special Needs Students. After 35 years teaching Special Education classes, I had the opportunity and the desire to start a school for children that needed specific attention. Students with Learning Disabilities, ADD, ADHD, Bi-polar, Terretts, Autistic Ausbergers, OCD, or any issue needing specific attention in a structured and consistent environment.</p>

<p>The academic program is an accumulation of testing for placement, prior records, parent’s home surveys, therapist’s observation and suggestions and/or psychologist’s recommendations. After a thorough review of the students learning styles, abilities and the other information, a program is set up for that particular student. It is specifically designed to include impute from those involved with the student. The goal of West Memorial Academy is to facilitate the advancement of each student to the next developmental stage in life.</p>
           
<p>The Social Skills Program is a large part of the curriculum. It is specifically written into each and every schedule. The program is designed to teach the appropriate behaviors that involve daily routines. Students are expected to act and respond appropriate in the classroom and when they are on an outing, away from the parent and siblings.</p>
           
<p>West Memorial Academy involves its student’s with community projects, such as preparing meals on wheels for different groups, volunteering to sell pumpkins before Halloween, help with the set up at the George R. Brown Convention Center’s Thanksgiving Meal, the volunteer work that helps distribute items to the less fortunate during the Holiday’s has been a success, and many other projects that involve giving of oneself in so many levels.</p>
           
<p>WMA is the environment which we established for the child in grades 4-8 that would ultimately prepare him/her to feel the pride in one’s accomplishments   which builds self confidence. Once a student feels he can do it, he will do it! The path he has excelled on- will then go on forever!</p>
           
<p>WMA also has a tutoring program designed to work specially for students with special needs. I have worked closely with students teacher’s in different schools and grade levels, (actually pre-K programs through HCC courses) and found the interaction with these specific people makes the tutoring program work.</p>
           
<p>The Summer Camp Program goes through the end of August.  It emphasizes the academics taught during the regular year for the first part of the day. The second part of the day involves outings. We visit Museums in the museum district once a week, including the Printing Museum, the Natural Science Museum, The Children’s Museum, the Natural Science Museum, the Health and Science Museum, and other smaller interesting collections. We also go swimming, bowling, rock wall climbing, play lazar tag, create the most beautiful painted   figures at Glazed Over, and make our own kites and fly them in the park. We eat lunch at neighboring restaurants, Taco Bell, Mac Donald’s, Burger King, KFC, Boston Market, and once in a while we have picnics near the water park near the school. We learn to bake, make quilted pillows, use water colors to create works of art. The program is set up to invite a student to have faith in himself. Every child wants to have someone he/she can call “my best friend” and they begin to learn that the structure, or give and take, in a relationship must be established and what better way to communicate these skills to someone than share in a process of working and helping others. The concept sounds simple, but it has worked for generations. I have decided to take these concepts and put them to use in the classroom where children with special needs can receive the reinforcement and support. The structure and consistency only add to the growth of a child’s next developmental stage of his or her life.</p>
           
<p>I appreciate your time, as I am aware of the demands the new school year brings. I am located across from Stratford HS Track field on Tully Rd. I invite you or any referrals you send my way to visit and discuss West Memorial Academy.</p>
           
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Janine Wolgamott<br/>
Founder, West Memorial Academy</p>
